Okay so this looks Amazing To me But there is one Issue I am not able to select Any Content in it for now , They are getting highlighted on hover but i am not able to select any Content Bait , And We also have to make sure that User selects at least one Row for each content , Else we wont let him Move to next , So make sure you Handle the case where user can be informed about what he is missing if he tries to click on next , So make 2 sets , So i could see the total Flow of the form . 
MAke sure you dont change the look and feel cause this looks amazing for now , Also Its confusing that Title section bait is Selectable or not , We only know its clickable if we click on it , So maybe add a radio button in front
