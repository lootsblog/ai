Idea Title: SlimeBlock - The AI Content Shield
1. The Pain Point
Internet users are expressing growing frustration with the proliferation of low-quality, AI-generated text and images that "clog every image feed"  and pollute search engine results. They feel their ability to find authentic, human-created content is being actively undermined. This sentiment was captured perfectly by user u/JouniFlemming in r/SideProject, who wished for "A browser extension that removes all AI generated slime from any page that I open. Imagine adblock but for AI crap," adding that such a tool would be worth "much more than $5". Other users echo this, complaining about the difficulty of sifting through "a flood of annoying AI images" when searching for artistic references or factual information.   

2. The Proposed Solution (MVP)
The solution is a browser extension that blocks AI-generated content. The MVP would focus on the simplest effective method: blocking known sources. It would utilize a curated, regularly updated blocklist of domains known for hosting AI-generated content, similar to the community-maintained lists used with uBlock Origin. The extension would block search results from these domains and hide images hosted on them. The MVP's user interface would be minimal, featuring a toggle switch to enable or disable blocking and a button to "report a new AI site," allowing the community to help maintain the blocklist.   

3. Target User Base
The primary user base includes researchers, artists, designers, writers, and any internet user who values authenticity and is fatigued by the deluge of low-quality AI content. These users congregate in subreddits like r/SideProject, r/aiwars, r/firefox, r/chrome, and r/Anticonsumption.   

4. Monetization Opportunity
A freemium model is well-suited for this product. The basic blocklist functionality would be free, encouraging widespread adoption. A premium tier, priced at approximately $2 per month or $20 per year, could offer advanced features. These might include on-device image detection for a more sophisticated (post-MVP) blocking mechanism, customizable blocklist rules, and the ability to block AI-generated videos, another common user complaint.   

5. Confidence Score (1-10): 8
The pain point is visceral and growing in tandem with the AI boom. The MVP, a managed blocklist, is straightforward for a solo developer to build. The existence of projects like MantaGuard and community-built blocklists validates the market need. However, the fact that MantaGuard has zero reviews on the Chrome Web Store suggests it has failed to gain traction, indicating a wide-open opportunity for a more user-friendly or better-marketed alternative. The freemium model provides a clear pathway from user acquisition to revenue generation.
