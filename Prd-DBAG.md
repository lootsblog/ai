- Analyzes impact of destructive operations (UPDATE/DELETE/INSERT)
- Requires human approval for non-SELECT operations
- Executes queries safely with proper error handling

### MVP Scope
1. **Natural Language to SQL** - Intent extraction and query generation
2. **Schema Intelligence** - Automatic schema discovery and context
3. **Complex Query Handling** - Multi-table JOINs and aggregations
4. **Impact Analysis** - For UPDATE/DELETE/INSERT operations
5. **Approval Workflow** - UI-based approval for destructive operations
6. **Safe Execution** - Protected query execution

## 🔄 System Workflow

### **SELECT Query Flow**
```
User Input → Orchestrator Agent → Query Builder Agent → Execute → Response

1. User: "Show me all customers from California who ordered in last 30 days"
2. Orchestrator: Extract intent, identify as SELECT operation
3. Query Builder: 
   - Fetch schema for customers, orders tables
   - Generate JOIN query with date filtering
   - Optimize and validate
4. Execute: Run SELECT query safely
5. Response: Format and return results to user
```

### **UPDATE/DELETE/INSERT Query Flow**
```
User Input → Orchestrator → Query Builder → Impact Analysis → Approval → Execute → Response

1. User: "Update all product prices by 10% for electronics category"
2. Orchestrator: Extract intent, identify as UPDATE (requires approval)
3. Query Builder: Generate UPDATE query with JOINs if needed
4. Impact Analysis Agent: 
   - Estimate affected rows
   - Check foreign key impacts
   - Assess risk level
5. Approval: Create approval request in UI
6. Wait for human approval
7. Execute: Run approved query with monitoring
8. Response: Confirm execution with stats
```

## 🎯 MVP Features Specification

### **Feature 1: Natural Language Processing**
```
Capability: Convert user input to structured intent
Implementation:
├── LLM-based intent extraction (using LangGraph + Groq)
├── Entity recognition (tables, columns, operations, conditions)
├── Query type classification (SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT)
├── Complexity assessment (simple, complex, multi-table)
└── Ambiguity detection and clarification requests

Examples:
├── "Show customers from NY" → Simple SELECT
├── "Update prices for electronics" → UPDATE with approval needed
├── "Delete old orders and their items" → Complex DELETE with cascades
└── "Revenue by region last quarter" → Complex SELECT with JOINs/aggregation
```

### **Feature 2: Schema Intelligence**
```
Capability: Automatic database structure discovery
Implementation:
├── Real-time schema inspection via PostgreSQL catalogs
├── Foreign key relationship mapping
├── Sample data retrieval for context
├── Intelligent table/column suggestions
└── Schema caching (1-hour TTL)

Context Provided:
├── Table structures and column types
├── Primary/foreign key relationships
├── Index information for optimization
├── Sample data for understanding content
└── Constraint information for validation
```

### **Feature 3: Complex Query Handling**
```
Capability: Generate complex SQL with JOINs and aggregations
Implementation:
├── Multi-table JOIN operations (all types)
├── Aggregation functions and GROUP BY
├── Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
├── Window functions for advanced analytics
└── Query optimization and performance tuning

Supported Operations:
├── Single table: SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT
├── Multi-table: JOINs, correlated subqueries
├── Aggregations: COUNT, SUM, AVG, GROUP BY, HAVING
├── Analytics: Window functions, ranking, percentiles
└── Complex logic: CASE statements, conditional operations
```

### **Feature 4: Impact Analysis**
```
Capability: Assess risks of destructive operations
Implementation:
├── Row count estimation using query statistics
├── Foreign key cascade analysis
├── Referential integrity impact assessment
├── Risk classification (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
└── Rollback strategy generation

Analysis Output:
├── Estimated affected rows
├── Cascade effects (if any)
├── Risk level with justification
├── Rollback plan
└── Execution time estimate
```

### **Feature 5: Approval Workflow**
```
Capability: UI-based human approval for destructive operations
Implementation:
├── Automatic approval request creation
├── Web UI for approval/rejection
├── Approval status tracking
├── Operation queuing until approved
└── Audit trail for all approvals

Approval Triggers:
├── Any UPDATE operation
├── Any DELETE operation
├── Any INSERT operation
├── Estimated affected rows > 100
└── Operations on critical tables
```

### **Feature 6: Safe Execution**
```
Capability: Protected query execution with error handling
Implementation:
├── Transaction-wrapped execution for data consistency
├── Query timeout enforcement
├── Resource usage monitoring
├── Automatic rollback on errors
└── Execution statistics and logging

Safety Measures:
├── Transaction isolation for destructive operations
├── Query timeout limits (30s for SELECT, 5min for others)
├── Connection pooling and resource management
├── Comprehensive error logging
└── Automatic recovery procedures
```
